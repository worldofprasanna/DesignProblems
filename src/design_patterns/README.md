I started working in Python, so just to know about the basic constructs of python implementing the design patterns in `pythonic` way.

**Steps to run the project**

1. Create virtualenv `mkvirtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 design_problems`
2. `workon design_problems`
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. To run the test continously `sniffer` or `py.test -f src/`
